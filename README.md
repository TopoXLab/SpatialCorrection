This is the official repository for the ICLR 2023 paper **[Learning to Segment from Noisy Annotations: A Spatial Correction Approach](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Qc_OopMEBnC&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICLR.cc%2F2023%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions))**. This paper proposed a Markov model for simulating segmentation label noise, and a Spatial Correction method to combat such noise. The outline of this repository is given as follows.

## Requirements

Our code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS with CUDA 11.4 (Driver Version 470.161.03), Python 3.9.7, and PyTorch v1.10.2. Other requirements can be installed by
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Noisy Label Settings

The proposed method is compared with SOTAs in a wide range of noisy settings, including both synthetic and real-world noise.

### Synthetic Noise

Previous works used random dilation and/or erosion noise to simulate noisy annotations, while we propose a Markov process to model such noise. The comparison is as follows,

|Comparison of different types of noise. Blue lines are true segmentation boundaries, and red lines are noisy boundaries (after removing random flipping noise). $S_E$ and $S_S$ are generated by the proposed Markov mode.|
:-----:

The Markov noise generation follows Definition 1 in our paper. There are four parameters controlling this process, $T$ the number of steps, $\theta_1$ the noise preference, $\theta_2$ noise variance, $\theta_3$ random flipping noise rate. To generate the proposed Markov noise for you own dataset, run
```
python noise_generator.py --gts_root your/gt/root/ --save_root your/save/root/
```
To generate random dilation and erosion noise, add `--noisetype DE` to the above command.\
Other arguments can be set accordingly with detailed descriptions inside the function. To generate noisy labels used in Table 1 in the paper, refer to the following settings.

### Real-world Noise

We include Cityscapes and LIDC-IDRI datasets for real-world label noise settings. Detailed information can be found in the paper. Our selected Cityscapes dataset can be downloaed here soon.

## Test with Trained models

We provide the *JSRT* dataset with noisy setting **J1** in `./Datasets` and a trained model with the proposed Spatial Correction method in `./trained`. If you use *JSRT* dataset in your work, please cite their original publications. More trained models will be uploaded later.

For testing on the provided model, simply run `python test.py`. To test other models, change the paths in `test.py` accordingly and run the same command.

## Train on Your Own

## Train with datasets in the paper.

Change the relevant dataset path in `config.ini` or organize your data folder accordingly. Each dataset has its own section leading by `[dataset_name]`. Example commands and parameters for training model with each dataset are provided in `run.sh`.

## Train with your own dataset.

**Preparing Dataset and Code.** To train your own dataset, the first thing is to add another section in `config.ini` leading by `[your_dataset]`. Create similar path arguments as other sections. Second, create your own dataset class in `uitils/dataset.py` or modify existing ones to fit the structure of your dataset. Third, based on the modality and classes of your dataset, you might need to modify codes in `utils/training.py`, `utils/evaluation.py`, and `utils/LabelClean.py`. Note that you only need to modify relevant part (mostly some if/else conditions) to fit the dimension (same as 'Brats2020' if 3D, same as 'JSRT'/'ISIC2017' if 2D) and classes (same as 'JSRT' if multiple classes, same as 'ISIC2017'/'Brats2020' if single class). Last but not least, use the proper segmentaion network. You may put your network definition file in `net` folder.

**Tuning Parameters.** Apart from epochs `-e`, batch size `-b`, and learning rate `-lr`, there are other three parameters for cleaning noisy labels. `-s` is the hyper-parameter $\gamma$ in our paper ranged in $(0, 1]$. If too small, the label correction algorithm may not run depending the bias amount. First use a large value `-s 1`, which usually works in most cases. Then try to scale down to `-s 0.8` or `-s 0.4` to find the best performance. Other two relevant parameters are `-le` and `--max_iter`. The former is run label correction every `-le` epochs and start over training. The latter is the maximum iteration for the whole process.
